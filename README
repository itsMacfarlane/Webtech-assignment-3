A brief explanation of your web-site, the structure of your application, including every content file and every code file, the structure of your database:
- Our project is divided in maps for different uses.

- The "views" map contains the 2 views we use for the logging in, registering (both in "form" and used with a body paramater when rendering the page) and the page you can see when you are logged in (in "loggedin" which lets you change your personal information and go to the report page)

- app.js is the main executable which start everything up, creates routes for users and assessments, takes care of the gets for the static pages and requires most of the packages 

- the "routes" map is for the two routes we have, "assessment" and "users". With the first taking care of all the gets and posts that ajax does in the assessment pages, and the second one taking care of all the gets and posts regarding user login, registering and updating

- in the "public" map are all the client side files and maps
	- css holds our css file: hertog.css
	- javascript holds out clientside javascript, one to create the footer abilities, one to create the whole assessment.html page and one that does all the ajax in the assessment page
	- resources holds the images that we use on our website
	- and last but not least, loose html that are static 

- in "bin" is some auto generated www stuff for the server

- "temp files" holds database.sql which holds all the sqlite commands to create and fill our database

- "node-modules" holds all the modules that the server uses

- "database" holds database.db which holds all the required and acquired data
