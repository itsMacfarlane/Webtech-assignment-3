                A brief look at the history of HTML
            </h1>
            <p>
                HTML was originally developed by a man named
                <a

                computers to find different information and thought that there
                must be a better way. He figured that there must be a way to hop
                from one set of information to another thats on different
                computers. This concept of a hyper-text system (connected with
                the networking technology and protocols needed to pass
                information between computers) would go on to form the basis for
                the fundamental language of the world wide web: HTML. The first
                ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0. This original HTML was alot
                different than the HTML used today, it was far more limiting.
                The internet was not yet popularized, and few people were
                involved in web development. But for those that were involved in
                web development, they could not do much with HTML except get
                some simple text up on the web (the original HTML consisted of
                only 22 tags). This was only the beginning...

            <p>
                The web started to gain some popularity, and in 1995 HTML 2.0
                was released. HTML 2.0 was not much different from HTML 1.0
                except for a few new features.

        <article class="history-body__html-three-article body__article">
            <h2 class="html-three-article__title">HTML 3.0</h2>
            <p>
                At this point in time with the web getting more and more
                popular, more and more people were starting to learn HTML. These
                people wanted more -- they wanted more abilities, more tags, and
                more enhancement of their websites. In parallel at this time,
                Netscape was the leader in the browser market with its Netscape
                Navigator browser and to appease the people who wanted more and
                more, they created a set of proprietary tags (called Netscape
                extension tags) that would work only in Netscape Navigator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other browsers tried to emulate Netscape's actions as to
                continue to compete in the browser market, but were not able to
                get their browsers to display things as they intended. This
                resulted in a lack of 'browser consensus', where a webpage
                looked good in one browser, but bad in another browser. Webpage
                developers were upset and a new more advanced version of HTML
                was needed. For this reason, the HTML 3.0 draft was introduced.
                This draft included several new abilities and more powerful
                opportunities for webpage developers to create their webpages.
                But surprisingly, the web browsers were slow in implementing
                these new abilities and opportunities. They only added a few,
                and left out the rest. For this reason, the HTML 3.0 draft was
                abandoned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web browsers would haved probably performed faster
                implementations of new abilities if not for the large size of
                the overhaul. The people in charge understood this, and future
                changes to HTML were designed to be added in stages as opposed
                to in one large chunk. This way it would be easier for web
                browsers to adapt to the new changes.

        <article class="history-body__html-four-article body__article">
            <h2 class="html-four-article__title">HTML 4.0</h2>
            <p>
                Big changes came with HTML 4.0. It was a huge step in the
                evolution of HTML. In December of 1997, HTML 4.0 was published
                as a recommendation by the
                <abbr
                    title="The World Wide Web Consortium is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web."
                >
                    W3C</abbr
                >. This version of HTML was different than HTML 3.2 in a big
                way. HTML 3.2 contained several tags and attributes for styling
                things like text and links. While seemingly a good idea, it
                turned out to be very different. Webpage developers had to spend
                so much time manually coding font and color information on many
                different pages because of these styling tags and attributes.
                Besides, this is not what HTML was designed for. HTML was
                designed to specify the logical organization of a document.
            </p>
            <p>
                With HTML 4.0 this concept became actualized, as styling tags
                and attributes were deprecated. Styling pages is actually not
                part of HTML (at least not in the modern usage of HTML), but is
                actually a language all its own. As styling became separated
                from HTML, it became much easier to work with. No longer was it
                required for webpage developers to scour all those pages to
                manually change styles. They were now able to do so on one
                stylesheet (using a separate language called
                <abbr
                    title="Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML."
                >
                    CSS</abbr
                >). HTML 4.0 provided new tags for stylesheets, scripts, frames,
                embedded objects, more complex tables, more complex forms, and
                improved accessibility features for people with disabilities.
                HTML 4.0 became the official standard in April of 1998.

                HTML 4.01 is a revised version of HTML 4.0 that includes several
                changes to the HTML specification. Changes in the revision
                include the addition of certain attributes such as the name
                attribute for the &lt;form&gt; tag, usability functionality such
                as the ability to include text within the &lt;noframes&gt; tag
                for browsers that do not have frames enabled or do not support
                frames, and a new document type definition called 'Strict' which
                allows no usage of deprecated tags and attributes. Also included
                within the HTML 4.01 specification are some corrections to
                previous errors in the HTML 4.0 specification such as the
                &lt;frame&gt; tag containing the target attribute, and the

            <p>
                XHTML is the next phase in the evolution of HTML. The last
                version of HTML before XHTML was HTML 4.01. The first version of
                XHTML was XHTML 1.0, and the current version of XHTML is XHTML
                1.1. XHTML stands for eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language.
                XHTML is the next phase in the evolution of HTML. HTML 4.01 is
                the final version of HTML, which will eventually be replaced by
                XHTML. Not a completetly different language from HTML, XHTML is
                merely an advancement of it. With a bigger focus on adherence to
                standards and semantic code, XHTML is a stricter, but cleaner,
                and more efficient version of HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                XHTML contains rules for semantic code that must be followed
                including tags in XHTML must be properly nested, tags in XHTML
                must be closed, and tags in XHTML must be lowercase. In January
                of 2000, XHTML became a standard together with HTML 4.01.

                HTML5 is the latest specification of the HTML language, and
                represented a major break with previous markup practices. The
                purpose of the profound changes to the language was to
                standardize the many new ways in which developers were using it,
                as well as to encourage a single set of best practices with
                regards to web development. Most of the individual changes are a
                result of larger objectives in the design of the language. These
                objectives primarily include:
            </p>
            <ul class="article__list">
                <li>Encouraging semantic (meaningful) markup</li>
                <li>Separating design from content</li>
                <li>Promoting accessibility and design responsiveness</li>
                <li>Reducing the overlap between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
                <li>
                    Supporting rich media experiences while eliminating the need
                    for plugins such as Flash or Java
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Getting a handle on HTML5 isn’t just about learning which CSS
                features replace old HTML features. If you want to get an
                intuitive sense of HTML5, it is best to understand how these
                objectives affected the development of the language.
